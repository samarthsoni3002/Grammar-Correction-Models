# Grammar Correction Models
This is a repository that houses state-of-the-art grammar correction models, each leveraging different techniques for improving text accuracy and fluency. Whether you're looking for a character-level approach, a word embedding-based method, or an advanced attention model, this repository provides the tools to correct grammatical errors in text efficiently.

# Overview
This repository contains three distinct grammar correction models:

- Character-Level Model
A simple yet effective model that operates at the character level. It learns the structure of sentences character by character, making it ideal for correcting minor spelling and syntactic errors.

- Word Embeddings Model
This model takes advantage of GloVe word embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of words. It corrects grammatical errors based on the context provided by the surrounding words in the sentence.

- Attention Model
Inspired by the "Attention is All You Need" architecture, this model employs attention mechanisms to focus on key parts of a sentence. It provides superior accuracy by modeling long-range dependencies and word relationships more effectively.
